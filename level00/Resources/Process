Struggled to figure out what cipher was used.
Found in the Intra video that a readme was supposed to be present.
Found the readme online which indicated a caesar cipher.

Process:

`find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null`
This shows us what files relate to the user flag00 (which we need to have access to)

`cat /usr/sbin/john`

Used an online caesar cipher solver to get the flag.

(Looped through till 15 increments to find the correct code)
